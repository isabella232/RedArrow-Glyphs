RedArrow-Glyphs
===============

Now Glyphs users can also have red arrows!

This plugin points at possible outline errors, like FontAudit in FontLab Studio. This version only works in Glyphs 2.

### Installation

Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

Open a glyph in Edit View.
Use View > Show Red Arrows to toggle the arrows.

### Troubleshooting

If the plugin doesnâ€™t run: Check your Glyphs script folder for files called `GlyphsApp.py` or `GlyphsApp.pyc`.
Deleting these files should make RedArrow work again. The files may be recreated if you switch between Glyphs 1.4 and 2, so you could have to delete them again.

### Known bugs

This is a development version, so check back often for updates.
