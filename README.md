This is a very rudimentary version which only shows extremum point errors (and some smooth connection errors, including correct ones).

### Installation

Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

Open a glyph in Edit View.
Use View > Show Red Arrows to toggle the arrows.
