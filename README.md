RedArrow-Glyphs
===============

Now Glyphs users can also have red arrows!

This plugin points at possible outline errors, like FontAudit in FontLab Studio. This version only works in Glyphs 2.

When the plugin is active, red arrows will point to possible mistakes in your outlines.

These kinds of errors are detected:

* Missing extremum points
* Fractional coordinates
* Fractional transformations
* Incorrect smooth connections
* Empty segments
* Collinear vectors
* Semi-horizontal and semi-vertical lines
* Zero handles

### Installation

Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

Open a glyph in Edit View.
Use View > Show Red Arrows to toggle the arrows.

### Troubleshooting

If the plugin doesnâ€™t run: Check your Glyphs script folder for files called `GlyphsApp.py` or `GlyphsApp.pyc`.
Deleting these files should make RedArrow work again. The files may be recreated if you switch between Glyphs 1.4 and 2, so you could have to delete them again.

### Known bugs

This is a development version, so check back some time for updates.
